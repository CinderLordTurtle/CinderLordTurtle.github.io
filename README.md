Noita runes translator

A tool made for the game 'Noita' from Nolla Games.

DD's Noitranslator allows the user to translate the glyphs found in Noita into letters. The user can either click a rune or draw it manually to get the corresponding letter.

This is based on the translation key found on https://noita.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Lore#Key.
